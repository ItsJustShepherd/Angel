Angel takes advantage of Google Earths .kml files and of infrastructure network cameras that are openly accessible through OsInt to give the users of Angel ease-of-access to a 3d mapped zones and over layered cameras across the United Kingdom with key-cities having their own .kml files, I'll soon expand development into the United States with the end-goal being to map the planet!<br><br>
I will be releasing a short-blog tutorial on how to map your own cameras and how to find them legally though OsInt too!<br><br>
